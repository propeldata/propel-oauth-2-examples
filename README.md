# Multi-Language OAuth Token Fetcher

Welcome to the Multi-Language OAuth Token Fetcher project. This repository contains examples and tests for fetching OAuth tokens using various programming languages. The purpose of this project is to illustrate how to implement OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow in different tech stacks.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple directories, each corresponding to a specific programming language. Within each directory, you'll find a practical implementation example and tests to verify the correct creation of OAuth tokens.

Here's what you can expect in each directory:

- `/javascript`: Contains JavaScript example using `simple-oauth2`.
- `/typescript`: Contains TypeScript example using `simple-oauth2`.
- `/python`: Contains Python example using `requests-oauthlib`.
- `/golang`: Contains Go example using `golang.org/x/oauth2`.
- `/dotnet`: Contains .NET example using `IdentityModel`.
- `/rust`: Contains Rust example using `reqwest`.
- `/ruby`: Contains Ruby example using `oauth2`.

Each directory has its own `README.md` file with detailed instructions on setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the tests.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate into the directory of the language you're interested in.
3. Follow the language-specific `README.md` for instructions on how to install dependencies and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running any code, make sure you have the following:

- Git installed on your system.
- Appropriate language-specific environment setup (links to each environment setup guide are provided in the language directories).
